# Flight Delay Prediction 

This project aims to predict flight delays using a logistic regression model. The model is trained on a preprocessed dataset that includes various features related to flight details.

## Project Structure

- `T2.py`: The main script for training the model, making predictions, and evaluating the model performance.
- `Project_combinedflight.csv`: The preprocessed dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `evaluation_results.txt`: The output file containing the evaluation results of the model.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark 3.x
- pandas

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install pyspark pandas
