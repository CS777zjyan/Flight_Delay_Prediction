# Flight Delay Prediction 

## Overview

This project contains two Python script files, `T1.py` and `T2.py`. Each file implements different functionalities and may be used in various application scenarios. Below is a detailed description of each file.

## File Descriptions

### T1.py

#### Functionality

`T1.py` implements the following features:
- Detailed description of the script's specific functionality, such as data processing, model training, data analysis, etc.
- Explanation of the script's inputs and outputs.
- Detailed description of the main modules and functions.

```bash
python T1.py

### T2.py

Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions over the total predictions.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions over the total positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions over the actual positive instances.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
